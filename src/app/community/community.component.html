  <h5><span class="bold">Community</span> will take ideas from the world community at large meaning not me. I will examine the ideas presented by other other individuals. Usually these ideas will be presented by a youtube video of some sort and I will go over the validitiy of their teaching or just what I think about it. Most of these teachings/ideas are things we should incorporate in our own lives if we have not done so. Sometimes it won’t be an idea at all. Sometimes we will examine the lives of diffferent inviduals.</h5>

  <h5>I have to credit Stephen Covey for introducing me to the world of self-help. It was the first self-help book I ever read and I couldn’t put it down. It took me less than three days to finish Seven Habits of Effective People. I try to incoporated all seven habits in my own life. All the habits has something to offer. But, today let’s focus on his first habit being proactive.</h5>

  <h5>This is the most important of the seven habits, which is to take action to better your situation. We all live in an ever-changing world and things are changing faster than ever. It is inevitable there will be things along our life journey that we do not like and don’t expect. The worse two possible combination of occurences. We can choose to prepare for negative occurences we expect. But, when bad things we don’t expect, it can often shake us to the core. We start second guessing our judgement, puts our value system into question, and we inevitably lose confidence.</h5>

  <h5>The only way to turn the tide, is to start moving forward. It is to get proactive. Not an easy task. But, that is why it will only make you stronger and rebuild that confidence. By moving ever so slightly towards progress, we can begin anew. Everytime something bad happens, I turn my attention towards a different part of my life and start to build upon the good things, I have built. This gives me the confidence to fight the other demons at a better time and mental state of my choosing. By being proactive you are taking control of the areas of your life you can control. </h5>

  <h5>As you seek to be more responsible and accountable for your actions, your abilities and skills will only grow from there. We will definitely come back to other contributions made by Stephen Covey, but for now let’s start with something simple. Be proactive. When you think something to do, just go out and do it. Be less reactive, become the influencer.</h5>
